# ES6 Basics

Welcome to the ES6 Basics project! This project will help you understand and utilize the new features introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015. By the end of this project, you will have a good grasp of key ES6 features.

## Introduction

ECMAScript 6, or ES6, is a significant update to JavaScript that includes numerous new features and improvements. This project covers important ES6 concepts such as block-scoped variables, arrow functions, template literals, and more.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand what ES6 is and its new features.
- Differentiate between constants and variables.
- Utilize block-scoped variables.
- Implement arrow functions and default parameters.
- Use rest and spread parameters.
- Apply string templating.
- Create objects and use their properties in ES6.
- Work with iterators and `for-of` loops.

## Requirements

- All your files will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x.
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the `.js` extension.
- Your code will be tested using the Jest Testing Framework.
- Your code will be analyzed using the linter ESLint with specific rules provided.
- All of your functions must be exported.

## Setup

1. **Install NodeJS 12.11.x**
   ```bash
   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
   sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
   sudo apt install nodejs -y
   nodejs -v
   npm -v
   ```

2. **Install Jest, Babel, and ESLint**
   In your project directory, install Jest, Babel, and ESLint by using the supplied `package.json` and running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Tasks

### Task 0: Const or let?
Modify functions to use `const` and `let`.

### Task 1: Block Scope
Ensure variables aren't overwritten inside conditional blocks.

### Task 2: Arrow functions
Rewrite functions using ES6’s arrow syntax.

### Task 3: Parameter defaults
Define default parameter values.

### Task 4: Rest parameter syntax for functions
Return the number of arguments using rest parameter syntax.

### Task 5: The wonders of spread syntax
Concatenate arrays and strings using spread syntax.

### Task 6: Take advantage of template literals
Rewrite return statements using template literals.

### Task 7: Object property value shorthand syntax
Use shorthand syntax for object properties.

### Task 8: No need to create empty objects before adding in properties
Use computed property names on objects.

### Task 9: ES6 method properties
Use ES6 method properties in objects.

### Task 10: For...of Loops
Use the `for...of` operator.

### Task 11: Iterator
Create an object with a department name and employees.

### Task 12: Let's create a report object
Create a report object containing all employees.
